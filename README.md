# Digit-prediction---Keras-TensorFlow-
Digit identification using MNIST dataset - powered by Keras &amp; TensorFlow 

**Summary:**

A prediction model, written in Python and powered by Keras (TF) that uses the MNIST dataset. This model is first trained on the training dataset, and then uses its knowledge to identify a set amount of digist from the testing dataset. The accuracy of the current model hovers at around 99.00%. 

**Powered by Keras:**

The Keras open-source machine learning library  that was developed by Google, is a multi-framework API, which can be compatible with other Python frameworks â€“ TensorFlow, PyTorch or JAX. This library is simple to set-up which allows to reduce development time, while also being powerful enough to be used by organizations like NASA (Keras, 2025). As it is a part of the TensorFlow ecosystem, it benefits from powerful features and extensive performance optimizations. 

**MNIST dataset**

This library contains 60,000 handwritten digits meant for training and 10,000 handwritten digits meant for testing.
